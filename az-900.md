## Pluralsight Path: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)

### MS Azure Services and Concepts

#### Understanding Azure Architecture and Management

Economies of Scale: the more resources you buy the cheaper each resource becomes.

ITPACS: IT Preassemble Components: containers of servers shipped separately

Security: Microsoft Data Centers addresses are not published, there are security guards and biometric authentification on site, Microsoft has more resources than the usual customer to dedicate to security

Energy efficiency: Carbon Neutral since 2012, 100% renewable energy until 2025. AI to manage operational costs

###### Azure Regions
Choose region, e.g. for storage accounts 

Important reasons to consider when choosing a region:

- not all services available in all regions
- performance matters
- local compliance reasons
- some resources like azure active directory are global resources

###### Azure Geographies
- Azure geographies contain one or more regions
- They help customers to meet data residency or data redudancy policies in a given region.

###### Region Pairs
- Region pairs are regions within a geography
- Data centers are usually 300+ miles apart 
- They help to recover from natural disasters or prevent failures within a region.
- Automatic replication and failover for azure services
- High availability (services updates and outage recovery prioritization)

###### Availability Zones
- Physically separated data centers available on some regions
- They help increase availability (uptime).
- (Services might need a load balancer if there are several availability zones)

###### Resource groups
 - Container that holds related resources
 - Resources share the same lifecycle
 - Resourves can only exist in one resource group
 - Resources can communicate across resource groups
 - Works also as a container for security boundaries
 - Can export using resource manager templates
 - Resources can be in different regions

###### ARM (Azure Resource Manager)
- Central to creating, editing and deploying resources 
- Ways to access ARM: azure sdks, azure portal, azure powershell, azure cli, api
- Create a webapp(PaaS)
- Create app service plan (includes costs for webapp)
- Create app service (actual webapp)

##### Azure Manager Templates
- Declarative JSON files containing infrastructure and configuration.

##### Azure Service Health
- Shows an overview of health in all regions
- Health advisisories
- Security advisories
- Create alerts (can be email, sms or push notifications on azure app)

##### Azure Monitor
- Shows metrics about resource groups 
- Can create an alert if a resource threshold has been reached, e.g. traffic or memory consumption
- Insights on:
    - applications (details about running apps)
    - virtual machines (processes on linux an MS vms)
    - storage accounts (capacity and health)
    - containers
    - networks (monitor traffic)

##### Azure (mobile) app 
- Easy, secure way to monitor your azure deployments even if you are out of the office
- Allows to:
    - access Azure Monitor
    - run commands
    - check the health of resource groups
    - give access to storage accounts
    - show metrics about vms, start and login to a vm

##### Azure Advisor
- It serves like a free cloud consultant
- Helps to optimize resource usage and costs, point out security issues, optimize performance and liability
- Provides recomendations on: 
    - security,
    - cost,
    - reliability,
    - operational excellence,
    - performance
- Features:
    - Quick fix option for some security issues
    - Postpone or dismiss recomendations
    - Configurations: e.g. remove certain resource groups from monitored resources
    - Create advisor alerts (for all groups/for a given urgency)
    - Trigger actions (e.g. send notifications or run commands)

#### Exploring Azure Core Products

Understanding Azure compute:
- VM (IaaS)
- Containers (IaaS)
- Azure app service (PaaS)
- Serverless Computing

Characteristics:
- Easy to provision new resources 
- Pay for what you use
- PAAS options available
- Scale depending on workloads

##### Virtual machines
- IAAS full control over VMs (including operating system)
- Must maintain and patch VM
- decisions: type of image, size of image, availability

Create resources -> VM

VM can be vainilla OSes or can contain preinstalled software like SQL server or oracle db or a developer environment with vscode

VM scale set are identical virtual machines with load balancing, number of vms can scale out or in, spread across fault domains and automatical load balances, only pay for underlying resources)
Azure batch creates a pool of virtual machines

- VMs can install custom software, can shut down to save costs (manually or on a schedule)
- enables hybrid cloud (some servers on premise some servers on the cloud)
- familiar administrative model
- lift and shift migration (azure site recovery, azure migrate) (move existing vms on premise to the cloud)
- total cost of a vm depends on computing power costs storage costs networking costs etc.

##### Containers
- Azure container registry (container image registry)
- Azure container instances (ACI)
    - smaller applications
    - single container instance per container image
- Azure Kubernetes Service
    - container management system in Azure
    - scale our container-based applications
    - Monitor and deploy containers
    - nodes are virtual machines
    - can leverage VM scale sets
    - can use the Azure container registry
    - Azure Monitor (monitor performance and health of cluster)

    - framework runtimes installed on servers
    - Azure manages the platform (software on those servers)
    - can run: webapps, api apps, mobile apps, containers, webjobs
    - requires an app service plan: defines the size of the vms, ram and storage
    - you can start small and build app as you need for more features (there is a free plan)
    - can  handle authentication and tls/ssl settings
    - deployment slots can be used to have differente deployments (e.g. for production and development)
    - KUDU portal, shows all the environment variables, gives a console and a process explorer

    - Azure Virtual Network
        - Vnet
            - Subnet
    - Can enable communication between virtual networks using VNET Peering
    - can/should use load balancers to balance traffic to different resources (e.g. vms with public ip addresses)
    - load balancers can be public or private (public: handles traffic coming from the internet, private: handles traffic inside the vnet or from on-premise systems)
    - Azure Application Gateway can offer more features and security as a vanilla load balancer
        - SSL termination
        - autoscaling
        - session affinity (users return to a session after finishing it)
        - http header rewriting
        - advanced routing
        - web application firewall (WAF protects from sql injections and other bad things)

    - Hybrid cloud: connect vnet and premise network (e.g. put web servers in azure and db on-premise, or create vms on azure as a fallback to on-premises vms)
        - create connection using a VPN gateway ( require a VPN device on-premise to create site-to-site gating)
        - point-to-site VPN
    - Express route: private connection doesn't go over the internet
        - 3-rd party provider (have infrastructure on azure data centers, like att and verizon) creates a connection between your on-premise system and theirs, then they handle the connection to the azure vnet
        - express route direct (more speed and more security, useful for big customers like banks and goverments)
        - costs: metered data (per GB outbound), unlimited data (monthly fee)
        - bandwidth: 50 mbps to 10Gbps, 100gbps on express route direct

    - can connect to several backend services (called origin server)
    - the cdn server exposing the cached data is called the edge server
    - edge servers are placed at Point-of-presence locations on cdn regions (not the same as the other regions)
    - cdn servers are made of profiles and endpoints
    - endpoint is a url that points to the content and allows an specific behaviour to caching e.g. depending on the content
    - a cdn profile is a collection of endpoints, cdn is priced at profile level (similar to app service plan)
    - dynamic site acceleration helps retrieve dynamic data in response to user behaviour
    - e.g. via route optimization, tcp optimization, persistent connections, adaptive image compresion
